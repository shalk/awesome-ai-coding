## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution
2. **Add your entry** to the appropriate section in README.md
3. **Follow the formatting guidelines** below
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your addition

## Guidelines for Adding Tools

### Quality Standards

- The tool should be actively maintained and publicly available
- It must be specifically related to AI-powered coding or software development
- Free, open-source, or with a clear free tier preferred
- Avoid duplicates - check if the tool already exists in the list

### Formatting

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
- [Tool Name](https://tool-url.com/) - Brief, clear description of what the tool does.
```

**Description guidelines:**
- Start with a capital letter and end with a period
- Be concise (one sentence preferred)
- Focus on what the tool does, not marketing language
- Highlight the key feature or use case
- Avoid superlatives like "best", "amazing", "revolutionary"

**Good examples:**
```markdown
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - AI-first code editor built on VSCode with native chat and editing capabilities.
- [Aider](https://aider.chat/) - AI pair programming in your terminal, works with GPT-4, Claude, and local models.
```

**Bad examples:**
```markdown
- [Tool](https://example.com/) - The best AI coding tool ever made! (too promotional)
- [Tool](https://example.com/) - A tool (too vague)
- [Tool](https://example.com/) - An amazing revolutionary tool that will change everything (marketing language)
```

### Where to Add Your Entry
