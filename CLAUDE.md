## Content Guidelines

When adding or modifying entries:

- Follow the format: `- [Tool Name](url) - Brief description ending with period.`
- Descriptions should be one sentence, factual, and avoid marketing language
- Tools should be actively maintained and publicly available
- Check for duplicates before adding
- Place entries in the most appropriate category
- Maintain alphabetical ordering within categories when possible

## Development Workflow

This is a documentation-only repository:

- All content is Markdown
- No build system, tests, or compilation required
- Changes primarily involve editing README.md
- Verify all links are functional before committing
- Follow Contributing guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- Standard PR workflow for contributions
- Commit messages should clearly describe what was added/changed
